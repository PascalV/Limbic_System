# LymbicSystem
## Inspiration
This work breaths from the paper from nature to develop Artificial Intelligence advacement through brain reverse engineering and bio inspiration. You can find the paper here 
http://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(17)30509-3.pdf

There is a part coming from waitbutwhy neurallink article that explores the functions behind the lymbic system, aiming for it as an advanced survival system . Developed lymbic system seem to be a biological sign about maturity  https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html

## Description -Source wikipedia-
The limbic system is a set of brain structures located on both sides of the thalamus, immediately beneath the cerebrum.[1] It has also been referred to as the paleomammalian cortex. It is not a separate system but a collection of structures from the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon.[2] It includes the olfactory bulbs, hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala, anterior thalamic nuclei, fornix, columns of fornix, mammillary body, septum pellucidum, habenular commissure, cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, limbic cortex, and limbic midbrain areas.[3]

The limbic system supports a variety of functions including emotion, behavior, motivation, long-term memory, and olfaction.[4] Emotional life is largely housed in the limbic system, and it has a great deal to do with the formation of memories.

# Main function description architecture 

Find bellow a descripcion of main parts and ideas regarding neural nets that could be implemented

THE AMYGDALA : Responds to fear, danger and anxiety. There are two parts of the amygdala that show an adversarial behaviour
Type of neural net that could be implemented : perceptron, adversarial neural net, logistic regression.
As other ideas, one shot learning -as a quick response to fear- 

THE HIPPOCAMPUS : memory survival mode approach 
Type of neural net that could be implemented : reinforced LSTM,

THE THALAMUS : sensory middle-dispositive conected with the cortex
Type of neural net that could be implemented : CNNs, RNNs, InceptionV3 and InceptionV4

ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX :image sensatory input 

SENSORY CORTEX : The sensory cortex process the senses information - visual, olfatory - and separates the sensory data 

As inputs, find two kinds differenciated:
SI - Sensory input. Images and words
ES - Emotional signal
