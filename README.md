In this folder you can find several experiments to reverse eingeniering documentation
Data gathering. Cognitive Experiments.  Neural Net Experimentation , from classification to Architecture model Design

Find bellow a descripcion of main parts and ideas regarding neural nets that could be implemented
THE AMYGDALA : Responds to fear, danger and anxiety. There are two parts of the amygdala that show an adversarial behaviour
Type of neural net that could be implemented : perceptron, adversarial neural net, logistic regression

THE HIPPOCAMPUS : memory survival mode approach 
Type of neural net that could be implemented : reinforce LSTM,

THE THALAMUS : sensory middle-dispositive conected with the cortex
Type of neural net that could be implemented : CNNs, RNNs

ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX :image sensatory input 

SENSORY CORTEX
